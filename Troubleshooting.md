# Troubleshooting

Please always first check the console for exceptions and errors.
Many exceptions are self-explanatory and can be fixed by reading the error message or after a quick google.

If you can't find a solution to your problem, please create a new issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/micartey/Cardinal-Anticheat/issues/new/choose) and provide the required information.
Issues without the required information will be closed without further notice.
