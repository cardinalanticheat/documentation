# Getting Started

Cardinal requires Java 8 or above to run. You can download the latest version of Java [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
If you want to use more advanced features that surpass the capabilities of spigot, you can take a look at the [tcpdump section](#allow-tcpdump).

## Choose an Edition

There are currently two editions available. They are different in features and pricing. 
Please check out the [pricing](/pricing) page to check out all the available information on the different editions.

### Download Community Edition

You can download the latest community version of Cardinal [here](https://github.com/micartey/Cardinal-Anticheat/releases).
The community edition contains most of the features but is limited in mainly support and the lack of a ban system.

### Buy Pro Edition

You can purchase a copy on [builtbybit](https://builtbybit.com/resources/cardinal-anticheat-cac.26622/) (also known as McMarket) or discord.
Until you receive your license key you can use the community edition to be able to configure Cardinal to your liking.

[!file Cardinal.jar](https://builtbybit.com/resources/cardinal-anticheat-cac.26622/)

To activate the license key you have to edit the `Config.yml` and change the last line to include your license key.
Restart the server and you are ready to go.
