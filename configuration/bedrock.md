## Setup

1. [Download GeyserMc](https://geysermc.org/download)
2. [Download Floodgate](https://geysermc.org/download?project=floodgate)

### Configure Geyser to use Floodgate

After starting your server once, it will generate the Geyser-Spigot config in your plugins directory.

Edit the config:

```yaml #5
remote: 
    
    # Change the auth-type to "floodgate" like below
    # This value is by default "online"
    auth-type: floodgate
```
