[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["Cardinal Anticheat is a minecraft anticheat that uses more than a hundred different checks to make players have a hard time hacking on your server. Each check is unique and designed specifically for Cardinal Anticheat trying to always find methods and ways that haven't been tested before. This offers a great advantage in keeping your server safe from hackers while known anti-cheats can't do the job."]},{"l":"Testserver","p":["If you are interested but don't want to buy a license right away try, you are welcome to join the official public testserver","In case the server is offline, please join the official discord server and give me a notice that you want to test the anticheat on the testserver."]},{"l":"Features","p":["Feature","Description","Addons","Cardinal also allows loading, developing and sharing addons. There are already some addons on my discord server. Furthermore, there is a rather good documentation for developsers on how to write your own addons here","Report System","Maybe you don't want a player to be banned right away or lower the chance of banning a legit player. For this reason it makes sense to use Cardinal's report system. Each flag is saved in the database using a dialect and based on the number and type of flags, a moderator can decide for himself when a player should be banned. For example you only ban the 10% of players with the most falgs each month etc. Maybe you want to introduce some form of trust factor and scale damage as a result. You might want to let players with similar trust factors play against each other. If you are a developer and want to get to implement such a system, the possibilities are limitless","Custom Ban Manager","By default Cardinal Anticheat doesn't handle a database connection. The reason is farily easy to understand. Cardinal Anticheat is a close source plugin whose source is never disclosed. This has legitimate security and privacy concerns","Built-in ban system","As already stated does Cardinal Anticheat not handle any database connections by default, however using the build-in ban system requires you to use a so called dialect which you have to write yourself. The documentation for writing a dialect is available here. Due to inquiries a dialect for the mongo and mysql driver has already been written. You can download them here"]}],[{"l":"Getting Started","p":["Cardinal requires Java 8 or above to run. You can download the latest version of Java here. For Java 9 and above take a look at the Run on Java 9+ Module System section. If you want to use more advanced features that surpase the capabilities of spigot, you can take a look at the tcpdump section."]},{"l":"Download Community Edition","p":["You can download the latest community version of Cardinal here. Please keep in mind that the community version is limited to 10 players and does not support the use of addons as well as banning players. The community version is only meant for testing purposes as well as to be able to give me feedback and report bugs. Really active community members can receive a free license key for the pro edition.","Getting Started"]},{"l":"Buy Pro Edition","p":["You can purchase a copy on builtbybit(also known as McMarket) or discord. Afterwards join my discord and notify micartey to receive your license key and being able to use all the features Cardinal provides. Until you receive your license key you can use the community edition to be able to configure Cardinal to your liking."]},{"l":"Active a license key","p":["To active the license key you have to edit the Config.yml and change the last line to include your license key. Restart the server and you are ready to go."]},{"i":"run-on-java-9-module-system","l":"Run on Java 9+ Module System","p":["Cardinal uses JCloak a project which aims to secure the jar file by providing additional runtime and decompiliation features. Because JCloak uses reflection and Java 9+ introduced a new module system the following JVM flag is mandatory for Java 9 and above:","It is overall questionable why Java 9+ introduced this module system in the first place as it breaks a lot of exisiting code."]},{"l":"Configure Netty","p":["Cardinal takes (as of the 4.x release) some time to handle the packets. This has no impact on the servers tps. Some packets (e.g. movement packets) trigger an environment update to be able to accuratly evaluate the players actions. These updates may take a few millisecounds. While this is not a lot, it can sum up when a lot of players are on the same thread resulting in a negative balance.","To fix this, simply edit the Spigot.yml and change the netty-threads to 3 times the expected amount players. This will assure a smooth gaming experience and fix any network delays you would've faced."]},{"l":"Sending to many Packets","p":["Cardinal sends a lot of packets to keep track of entity positions on the client side and other actions. Some Spigot forks and plugins like ViaVersion kick the player when they send a certain amount of packets per tick resulting in a kick. You can either increase the amount of packets or disable the tracking as Cardinal takes care of packet spamming"]},{"l":"Allow tcpdump","p":["Cardinal uses the tcpdump command to capture network packets at hardware layer. This may or may not create new possibilities for detecting cheaters. Currently tcpdump is only being used to detect blink. This command is not available on non-root users by default. To allow its use, you have execute the following command on your linux server:","In case tcpdump is not installed, you can install it by executing the following command:"]}],[{"l":"Commands","p":["A custom report system only for staffs in which each flag will be a 'report' which will be stored","Adds the ip-address of a player to the firewall rule and prevents any further communication","Bans a player permanently","cac ban","cac export","cac flag","cac import","cac info","cac iptable","cac reboot","cac reload","cac report","cac reset","cac unban","Command","Description","Export the current settings into a single file","Import settings from a file","Reloads configurations","Resets the violations of a player","Restarts the plugin","Shows the flags/alerts","Tells you whether a player is banned or not","Unbans a player"]}],[{"l":"Permissions","p":["Allows you to ban a player","Allows you to edit and manage reports","Allows you to freeze a player","Allows you to join even though your ip might be a proxy","Allows you to manage addons","Allows you to toggle alerts","Allows you to unban a player","Allows you to use most of the commands","Allows you to use tab-completeion","cardinal.common.addon","cardinal.common.alerts","cardinal.common.command","cardinal.common.freeze","cardinal.common.proxy","cardinal.common.tabcomplete","cardinal.manager.ban","cardinal.manager.report","cardinal.manager.unban","Description","Permission"]}],[{"l":"Addons","p":["To get a Git project into your build:","Add the JitPack repository to your build file","Add the dependency","Make sure to NOT export the source into your addon but use compileOnly for gradle and provided for maven.","After adding the addon api as a dependency, start by implementing Addon.","Unlike spigot, a file called addon.json must be created like following:"]}],[{"l":"Commands","p":["To handle commands you have to implement Command"]},{"l":"Register Commands","p":["You can register commands just like events with Extension.registerCommand"]}],[{"l":"Dialects","p":["As already mentioned, Cardinal Anticheat doesn't handle a database connection. The reason is farily easy to understand. Cardinal Anticheat is a close source plugin whose source is never on the server physically. This has legitimate security and privacy concerns. However, Cardinal Anticheat still has a build in ban system and other features, such as storing flags as so called reports.","A dialect is used to abstract the database handling by loading the dialect in form of an addon. Creating your own dialect secures the data usage and guarantees the protection of sensitive data, since Cardinal has neither access to the connection nor to any credentials which are typically required. In addition, this gives you the opportunity to migrate to any form of database you desire."]},{"l":"Getting Started","p":["You simply have to create a class and implement PunishDialect for bans and VialationDialect for reports. Both interfaces will require you to implement some methods but the implementation is up to you. You can use any database or filesystem to write and retrive the informations."]},{"l":"Register a dialect","p":["Registering a dialect is similar to any other event or command you're trying to register. Therefore you need to get the static reference of Extension and call the method registerDialect with the required arguments."]}],[{"l":"Events","p":["As you already know, you have to implement Listener to use bukkit events. In case you also want to use the build-in events of Cardinal-Anticheat you have to implement EventListener. That's because Cardinal-Anticheat has an entirely different event-system. It's possible to use bukkit events and cardinal events in the same class by implementing both classes.","The next difference is that Cardinal-Anticheat uses the annotation @EventManager.Target above methods. The annotation also ships with its own modifiers resulting in events being called asynchronous. This behavior can be changed by setting the isSync property to true.","Keep in mind, that asynchronous events cannot be cancelled. For a complete overview of all events, visit the javadoc reference."]},{"l":"Register Events","p":["You can register events by calling Extension.registerListener"]}],[{"l":"License Agreement","p":["This software and accompanying documentation (the \"Software\") is the property of micartey and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, and/or other intellectual property laws.
