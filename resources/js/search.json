[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["Cardinal Anticheat is a Minecraft anticheat that uses several novel approches to make players have a hard time hacking on your server. Each check is unique and designed specifically for Cardinal Anticheat always trying to find methods and ways that haven't been tested before. This offers a great advantage in keeping your server safe from hackers while known anti-cheats can't do the job."]},{"l":"Testserver","p":["If you are interested, you are welcome to join the official public testserver and try it yourself!","In case the server is offline, please join the official discord server and give me a notice that you want to test the anticheat on the testserver."]},{"l":"Features","p":["Apart from detecting cheaters, Cardinal Anticheat also offers a lot of other features that may be useful for you as a server owner.","Feature","Description","Bedrock Support","As one of few, Cardinal supports Bedrock. This includes detecting cheats while other anticheats only exempt/whitelist bedrock players (Experimental)","Addons","Cardinal also allows loading, developing and sharing addons. There are already some addons on my discord server. Furthermore, there is a rather good documentation for developers on how to write your own addons here","Reports","Each flag will be stored as a so called \"report\". Players with a lot of reports are very probably cheating. Moderators can vew a sorted list of the players with the most reports and decide to ban those with an unusual high amount of reports","Dialects","As closed source projects have legitimate doubts about security and privacy, Cardinal doesn't handle any database connections. Reading and writing is only possible through dialects which are a form of addons and provide a high level of security","Always-up to date","Cardinal uses a dynamic loading strategy that provides better support for versioning than other plugins, which also includes the loading of the newest release on startup. This provides better and easier hotfixes to everyone"]}],[{"l":"Getting Started","p":["Cardinal requires Java 8 or above to run. You can download the latest version of Java here. If you want to use more advanced features that surpass the capabilities of spigot, you can take a look at the tcpdump section."]},{"l":"Choose an Edition","p":["There are currently two editions available.

While each release is always tested and walks through several stages you might want to wait to verify that a new version is compatible and stable. To stay on a fixed version, you only have to set an environment variable before starting the server:","The current hash can be shown by executing the cac command and save the last 8 characters."]},{"l":"Use unreleased versions","p":["While stable versions are more beneficial, you might want to test out newer features, detections or fixes before it has been rolled-out. You can do this by setting another environment variable:"]}],[{"l":"From Zero to Hero","p":["From Zero to Hero is a series of resources that will help you to get started to develop with Cardinal. The series will cover the basics of the addon api and will also provide some examples.","It is recommended to start from the beginning and work your way through the series.

The reason is fairly easy to understand. Cardinal Anticheat is a close source plugin whose source is never on the server physically. This has legitimate security and privacy concerns. However, Cardinal Anticheat still has a build in ban system and other features, such as storing flags as so-called reports.","A dialect is used to abstract the database handling by loading the dialect in form of an addon. Creating your own dialect secures the data usage and guarantees the protection of sensitive data, since Cardinal has neither access to the connection nor to any credentials which are typically required. In addition, this gives you the opportunity to migrate to any form of database you desire."]},{"l":"Implement a dialect","p":["You simply have to create a class and implement PunishDialect for bans and VialationDialect for reports. Both interfaces will require you to implement some methods but the implementation is up to you. You can use any database or file system to write and retrieve the information."]},{"l":"Register a dialect","p":["Registering a dialect is similar to any other event or command you're trying to register. Therefore, you need to get the static reference of Extension and call the method registerDialect with the required arguments."]}],[{"l":"Events","p":["As you already know, you have to implement Listener to use bukkit events. In case you also want to use the build-in events of Cardinal-Anticheat you have to implement EventListener. That's because Cardinal-Anticheat has an entirely different event-system. It's possible to use bukkit events and cardinal events in the same class by implementing both classes.","The next difference is that Cardinal-Anticheat uses the annotation @EventManager.Target above methods. To make the events asynchronous, you can set the isAsync parameter to true(default is false).","Keep in mind, that asynchronous events cannot be cancelled. For a complete overview of all events, visit the javadoc reference."]},{"l":"Register Events","p":["You can register events by calling Extension.registerListener"]}],[{"l":"Troubleshooting","p":["Please always first check the console for exceptions and errors. Many exceptions are self-explanatory and can be fixed by reading the error message or after a quick google.","If you can't find a solution to your problem, please create a new issue on GitHub and provide the required information. Issues without the required information will be closed without further notice."]}],[{"l":"License Agreement","p":["This software and accompanying documentation (the \"Software\") is the property of micartey and is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, and/or other intellectual property laws.
